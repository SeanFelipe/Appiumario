#### Appium demo with Super Mario (sort of)


A little Appium stack in Ruby made to run against this demo app: [SuperMarioDroid](https://github.com/SeanFelipe/SuperMarioDroid)

Doing a bit of magic underneath the hood which you can look at here: [Screen Models](https://github.com/SeanFelipe/Appiumario/blob/master/features/screen_models/screen_models.rb)

Using the magic looks like this: [Step Definitions](https://github.com/SeanFelipe/Appiumario/blob/master/features/step_definitions/score_steps.rb)

Inspired by SitePrism, a long standing DSL for page models for web. [Site Prism](https://github.com/natritmeyer/site_prism)
